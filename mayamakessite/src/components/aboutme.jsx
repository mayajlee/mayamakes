            Welcome! My Name is Maya Lee, I’m a new computer science grad who’s 
            about to start her Software Engineering journey  this year. 
            Throughout my life I have found consistent enjoyment in technology, 
            art and sharing my opinions and hope one day to find a way to do all 
            three for a living! I hope you look around, have fun, and maybe 
            even hire me...
            </p>
